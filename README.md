     Solar Radiation Measurement Data Analysis

## Overview

This week’s challenge focuses on understanding, exploring, and analyzing solar farm data from Benin, Sierra Leone, and Togo. The challenge is part of an evaluation for a 12-week training program in Data Engineering (DE), Financial Analytics (FA), and Machine Learning Engineering (MLE).

Participants who advance will gain insights into required skills and traits, such as discipline, resilience, and proactivity. Those not progressing will receive feedback on areas for improvement. Regardless, all participants will gain valuable project experience to showcase in their professional profiles.

## Business Objective

- **Objective**: To analyze and gain insights from solar radiation measurement data.
- **Outcome**: Demonstrate capabilities in data analysis, visualization, and reporting.

### Solar Radiation Measurement Data

The dataset contains various measurements related to solar radiation and environmental conditions. Each row includes:

- **Timestamp**: Date and time of observation (yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm).
- **GHI (W/m²)**: Global Horizontal Irradiance.
- **DNI (W/m²)**: Direct Normal Irradiance.
- **DHI (W/m²)**: Diffuse Horizontal Irradiance.
- **ModA (W/m²)**: Sensor A measurements.
- **ModB (W/m²)**: Sensor B measurements.
- **Tamb (°C)**: Ambient Temperature.
- **RH (%)**: Relative Humidity.
- **WS (m/s)**: Wind Speed.
- **WSgust (m/s)**: Maximum Wind Gust Speed.
- **WSstdev (m/s)**: Standard Deviation of Wind Speed.
- **WD (°N)**: Wind Direction.
- **WDstdev**: Standard Deviation of Wind Direction.
- **BP (hPa)**: Barometric Pressure.
- **Cleaning (1 or 0)**: Indicator of cleaning events.
- **Precipitation (mm/min)**: Precipitation rate.
- **TModA (°C)**: Temperature of Module A.
- **TModB (°C)**: Temperature of Module B.
